Your travel agency tracks these credits to help ensure they are applied to newly reserved airline reservations before they expire and lose their value. Concur Travel does not compute the value or attempt to apply the credit. The rules for when and how to apply these credits are complex and require human interpretation to determine when they are applicable.
